# Machine-Learning-Coursera
I gather here programming exercises from Machine Learning Coursera (Prof. Wu Enda, Stanford University)

Files can be generally divided in two parts:
1) Linear Regression
2) Linear regression with multiple variables

ex1.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through the exercise ex1 multi.m - Octave/MATLAB script for the later parts of the exercise ex1data1.txt - Dataset for linear regression with one variable ex1data2.txt - Dataset for linear regression with multiple variables submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers 
[⋆] warmUpExercise.m - Simple example function in Octave/MATLAB 
[⋆] plotData.m - Function to display the dataset
[⋆] computeCost.m - Function to compute the cost of linear regression 
[⋆] gradientDescent.m - Function to run gradient descent
[†] computeCostMulti.m - Cost function for multiple variables
[†] gradientDescentMulti.m - Gradient descent for multiple variables 
[†] featureNormalize.m - Function to normalize features
[†] normalEqn.m - Function to compute the normal equations

IMPORTANT:
  To successfully visualize the data, give the code -- setenv("GNUTERM","qt") -- in Octave-cli. (Octave-gui does not need)
